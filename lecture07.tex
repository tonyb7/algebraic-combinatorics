\section{Expander Graphs}
Vaguely speaking, an expander graph is a sparse graph (\textit{i.e.}, it has few edges) which is nonetheless highly connected.
Expander graphs have applications to
\begin{itemize}
\item constructing error-correcting codes
\item derandomize algorithms
\item serve methods in number theory
\item hyperbolic manifolds
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[edge expansion ratio]
Lety \(G\) be a graph.
For \(S\subseteq V(G)\) denote the set of edges with one endpoint in \(S\) and one endpoint not in \(S\) by \(\partial S\).
Define the edge expansion ratio
\[ h(G)\coloneqq \min_{\substack{S\subseteq V(G)\\|S|\leq|V(G)|/2}} \frac{|\partial S|}{|S|} \]
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
A sequence of \(k\)-regular graphs \((G_n)_{n\in\N}\) is called a family of expander graphs if
\[ |V(G_0)|<|V(G_1)|<\cdots \]
and there exists \(\varepsilon>0\) such that \(h(G_n)\geq0,\forall n\in\N\).
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
It's relatively easy to show that such families exist by probabilistic arguments, but it's relatively difficult to construct them explicitly.
\end{remark}
\begin{theorem}
Suppose \(G\) is connected and \(k\)-regular so \(\lambda_1(G)=k\), then
\[ \frac{k-\lambda_2(G)}{2}\leq h(G)\leq \sqrt{2k(k-\lambda_2(G))} \]
\end{theorem}
Therefore a family \((G_n)_{n\in\N}\) of \(k\)-regular graphs with \(|V(G_0)|<|V(G_1)|<\cdots\) forms a family of expander graphs \iff there exists \(\varepsilon'>0\) such that
\[ k=\lambda_2(G_n)\geq\varepsilon' \quad \forall n\in\N \]
The spectral gap \(k-\lambda_2(G)\) or sometimes \( \min\{|k-\lambda_2{G}|,k-|\lambda_n(G)|\} \) measures how rapidly a random walk on \(G\) mixes.

Hi everybody,

I am very glad we could have such a team contributing to this course notes project!
I'm Dingyu Wang (libai).
To keep this project going well (complete and accurate), I think it's important to communicate. 
Do you guys mind leaving your email addresses here? I'll leave my email address first (below the letter).

By the way, I am willing to type down the notes of every Wednesday's class (from next week, i.e. Jan 17). So you guys do not need to bother typing Wednesday's notes.

Best,
Dingyu

Welcome any suggestions (I am not the founder of this).
